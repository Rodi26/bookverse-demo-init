# BookVerse Platform - Clean Repository Creation and Initialization Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This comprehensive repository management script automates the creation of
# clean, production-ready BookVerse service repositories with advanced
# initialization procedures, development artifact cleanup, and GitHub integration
# for enterprise-grade microservices repository structure and independent
# CI/CD operations across the complete BookVerse platform ecosystem.
#
# 🏗️ CLEAN REPOSITORY CREATION STRATEGY:
#     - Production-Ready Initialization: Clean repository creation without development artifacts
#     - Service Isolation: Complete service code isolation with independent Git history
#     - Artifact Cleanup: Comprehensive removal of development artifacts and cache files
#     - GitHub Integration: Automated GitHub repository creation with interactive confirmation
#     - CI/CD Optimization: Repository structure optimization for independent CI/CD operations
#     - Safety Mechanisms: Dry run mode and interactive confirmation for safe operations
#
# 🔧 INITIALIZATION PROCEDURES:
#     - Advanced File Copying: rsync-based file copying with comprehensive exclusion patterns
#     - Git Repository Setup: Complete Git repository initialization and configuration
#     - Branch Management: Main branch setup and initial commit structure
#     - Remote Configuration: GitHub remote repository setup and authentication
#     - Interactive Confirmation: User confirmation for repository recreation and overwrite
#     - Error Recovery: Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
#
# 🛡️ ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE:
#     - Safe Repository Operations: Comprehensive safety mechanisms for repository operations
#     - Authentication Management: Secure GitHub authentication and authorization
#     - Repository Access Control: Private repository creation with secure access management
#     - Audit Trail: Complete repository creation and configuration audit logging
#     - Data Protection: Secure handling of sensitive data during repository operations
#     - Rollback Capabilities: Repository operation rollback and disaster recovery
#
# 🔄 REPOSITORY LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
#     - Artifact Cleanup: Automated removal of development artifacts (.venv, __pycache__, node_modules)
#     - Repository Validation: Git repository integrity validation and verification
#     - Workspace Management: Temporary workspace creation and cleanup procedures
#     - Interactive Workflow: User-guided repository creation with confirmation prompts
#     - Batch Processing: Support for multiple service repository creation
#     - Status Reporting: Comprehensive status reporting and operation logging
#
# 📈 SCALABILITY AND AUTOMATION:
#     - Dry Run Mode: Safe testing and validation without actual repository changes
#     - Batch Processing: Efficient processing of multiple service repositories
#     - Template-Based Creation: Consistent repository structure and configuration
#     - Error Recovery: Automated error recovery and repository cleanup procedures
#     - Performance Optimization: Optimized file operations and Git performance
#     - Monitoring Integration: Repository creation monitoring and status reporting
#
# 🔐 ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES:
#     - Dry Run Validation: Complete operation validation without making changes
#     - Interactive Confirmation: User confirmation for destructive operations
#     - Data Protection: Protection against data loss during repository operations
#     - Rollback Mechanisms: Complete rollback capabilities for failed operations
#     - Validation Framework: Repository integrity validation and verification
#     - Security Scanning: Repository security validation and compliance checking
#
# 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
#     - GitHub CLI Integration: Native GitHub repository management via gh CLI
#     - rsync Operations: Advanced file copying with comprehensive exclusion patterns
#     - Git Operations: Advanced Git repository management and configuration
#     - Workspace Management: Temporary workspace creation and cleanup procedures
#     - Error Handling: Comprehensive error detection and recovery procedures
#     - Validation Framework: Repository validation and integrity checking
#
# 📋 SUPPORTED ARTIFACT CLEANUP:
#     - Python Artifacts: .venv, __pycache__, *.pyc, .pytest_cache cleanup
#     - Node.js Artifacts: node_modules and npm cache cleanup
#     - Database Artifacts: *.db and development database cleanup
#     - Git Artifacts: .git directory exclusion for clean repository creation
#     - Cache Artifacts: Development cache and temporary file cleanup
#     - Build Artifacts: Build output and compiled artifact cleanup
#
# 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
#     - Repository Creation: Successful creation of clean service repositories
#     - Artifact Cleanup: Complete removal of development artifacts and cache files
#     - CI/CD Readiness: Repository structure optimized for independent CI/CD operations
#     - Security Compliance: Repository security configuration meeting enterprise standards
#     - Interactive Validation: User-guided operation with confirmation and validation
#     - Operational Excellence: Repository management ready for production operations
#
# Authors: BookVerse Platform Team
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2024
#
# Dependencies:
#   - GitHub CLI (gh) with authentication (repository management)
#   - Git with proper configuration (version control operations)
#   - rsync for advanced file copying (file operations)
#   - Bash 4.0+ with array support (script execution environment)
#   - Network connectivity to GitHub (repository creation and push operations)
#
# Usage:
#   ./create-clean-repos.sh [organization] [dry_run]
#   - organization: GitHub organization name (default: yonatanp-jfrog)
#   - dry_run: true/false for dry run mode (default: false)
#
# Safety Notes:
#   - Use dry run mode for testing and validation before actual operations
#   - Interactive confirmation prompts for destructive operations
#   - All operations performed in isolated temporary workspace
#   - Original repository structure preserved and unmodified
