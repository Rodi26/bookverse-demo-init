# BookVerse Platform - Repository Splitting and Git Operation Safety Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This comprehensive repository management script automates the splitting of
# BookVerse monorepo into individual service repositories, implementing
# enterprise-grade Git operations, repository cleanup, and GitHub integration
# for production-ready microservices repository structure and independent
# CI/CD operations across the complete BookVerse platform ecosystem.
#
# 🏗️ REPOSITORY SPLITTING STRATEGY:
#     - Monorepo Decomposition: Safe extraction of individual services from monorepo structure
#     - Service Isolation: Complete service code isolation with independent Git history
#     - GitHub Integration: Automated GitHub repository creation and configuration
#     - CI/CD Preparation: Repository structure optimization for independent CI/CD operations
#     - Git Safety: Comprehensive Git operation safety mechanisms and error handling
#     - Cleanup Automation: Automated cleanup of development artifacts and temporary files
#
# 🔧 GIT OPERATION SAFETY:
#     - Temporary Directory Isolation: Safe operations in isolated temporary directories
#     - Error Handling: Comprehensive error detection and recovery for Git operations
#     - Repository Validation: Git repository integrity validation and verification
#     - Remote Management: Safe remote repository management and authentication
#     - Branch Management: Secure branch creation and main branch configuration
#     - Push Safety: Protected push operations with conflict detection and resolution
#
# 🛡️ ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE:
#     - Safe Git Operations: Comprehensive safety mechanisms for Git repository operations
#     - Authentication Management: Secure GitHub authentication and authorization
#     - Repository Access Control: Private repository creation with secure access management
#     - Audit Trail: Complete repository creation and configuration audit logging
#     - Cleanup Security: Secure cleanup of sensitive data and development artifacts
#     - Rollback Capabilities: Repository operation rollback and disaster recovery
#
# 🔄 REPOSITORY LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
#     - Service Extraction: Clean extraction of service code from monorepo structure
#     - Artifact Cleanup: Automated removal of development artifacts and cache files
#     - Repository Initialization: Complete Git repository initialization and configuration
#     - Remote Configuration: GitHub remote repository setup and authentication
#     - Branch Setup: Main branch configuration and initial commit structure
#     - Integration Ready: Repository preparation for CI/CD and workflow integration
#
# 📈 SCALABILITY AND AUTOMATION:
#     - Batch Processing: Support for multiple service repository creation
#     - Template-Based Creation: Consistent repository structure and configuration
#     - Error Recovery: Automated error recovery and repository cleanup procedures
#     - Integration Testing: Repository creation validation and integration testing
#     - Performance Optimization: Optimized file operations and Git performance
#     - Monitoring Integration: Repository creation monitoring and status reporting
#
# 🔐 ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES:
#     - Idempotent Operations: Safe re-execution and conflict resolution
#     - Data Protection: Protection against data loss during repository operations
#     - Rollback Mechanisms: Complete rollback capabilities for failed operations
#     - Validation Framework: Repository integrity validation and verification
#     - Security Scanning: Repository security validation and compliance checking
#     - Backup Integration: Repository backup and recovery procedure integration
