# BookVerse Screenshots

## Homepage Screenshot

To add the BookVerse homepage screenshot:

1. **If BookVerse is running**: Take a screenshot of `http://bookverse.demo` 
2. **Save as**: `bookverse-homepage.png` in this directory
3. **Recommended size**: 1200x600 pixels
4. **Should show**: Product catalog, search, recommendations, and overall UI

## Alternative: Automatic Screenshot

If you have Node.js and want to automate:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
node ../take_screenshot.js
```

This will automatically capture the homepage and save it here.
