# BookVerse Repository Architecture

## Overview

The BookVerse platform consists of multiple GitHub repositories organized to support microservices architecture and clear separation of concerns.

### Repository Structure

**Core Services:**
- `bookverse-inventory` - Book catalog and inventory management service
- `bookverse-recommendations` - Book recommendation engine service  
- `bookverse-checkout` - Shopping cart and checkout service
- `bookverse-platform` - Shared platform components and aggregation service

**Infrastructure & UI:**
- `bookverse-web` - Frontend web application and UI assets
- `bookverse-helm` - Kubernetes Helm charts for all environments
- `bookverse-demo-init` - Demo setup, automation scripts, and documentation

### Naming Conventions

**GitHub Repositories:**
- All repositories prefixed with `bookverse-`
- Service names match their functional purpose
- Clear distinction between services, infrastructure, and tooling

**JFrog Repositories:**
- Service-specific repositories for each microservice
- Shared repositories for common dependencies
- Environment-specific promotion stages (DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD)

### CI/CD Integration

Each repository includes:
- **Automated builds** triggered on code changes
- **Quality gates** with testing and security scans
- **Promotion workflows** for artifact progression
- **Deployment automation** for Kubernetes environments

### Dependency Management

**Shared Libraries:**
- Common BookVerse core libraries in `bookverse-platform`
- Shared configuration and utilities across services
- Centralized dependency version management

**Service Dependencies:**
- Each service manages its own specific dependencies
- Clear dependency mapping in repository configurations
- Automated dependency updates and security patches

### Environment Mapping

**Development Flow:**
- Local development → DEV stage → QA stage → STAGING stage → PROD stage
- Each stage maps to specific JFrog repositories and Kubernetes namespaces
- Automated promotion between stages based on quality gates

**Note**: This architecture supports independent service development while maintaining platform-wide consistency and shared tooling.
