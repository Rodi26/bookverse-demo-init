# BookVerse Promotion Workflows

## Overview

The BookVerse platform uses automated promotion workflows to move artifacts through development stages: DEV → QA → STAGING → PROD. These workflows integrate with JFrog AppTrust for lifecycle management and validation.

### What It Does

The promotion system automatically:

1. **Validates Artifacts**
   - Runs quality gates and security scans
   - Verifies build requirements and tests
   - Checks artifact integrity and signatures

2. **Promotes Through Stages**
   - Moves successful artifacts from DEV to QA to STAGING to PROD
   - Updates lifecycle stages in JFrog AppTrust
   - Maintains promotion history and audit trails

3. **Handles Failures**
   - Stops promotion on failed quality gates
   - Provides rollback capabilities
   - Sends notifications for failed promotions

### Lifecycle Stages

- **DEV**: Development builds and initial testing
- **QA**: Quality assurance and automated testing
- **STAGING**: Pre-production validation and integration testing
- **PROD**: Production-ready releases

### Promotion Triggers

**Automated Triggers:**
- Successful CI/CD pipeline completion
- Passing quality gates and security scans
- Scheduled promotion windows

**Manual Triggers:**
- Developer-initiated promotions via GitHub Actions
- Emergency hotfix promotions
- Rollback operations

### Quality Gates

Each promotion stage includes validation:

- **Code Quality**: Linting, testing, coverage thresholds
- **Security**: Vulnerability scans, dependency checks
- **Performance**: Load testing, performance benchmarks
- **Integration**: API testing, service compatibility

### How to Use

**Automatic Promotion:**
Most promotions happen automatically when CI/CD pipelines succeed and quality gates pass.

**Manual Promotion:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions in the service repository
2. Select "Promote" workflow
3. Choose target stage (QA/STAGING/PROD)
4. Monitor promotion progress

**Rollback:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Rollback" workflow
3. Choose target version to rollback to
4. Confirm rollback operation

### Monitoring

**Promotion Status:**
- Check GitHub Actions for promotion workflow status
- View JFrog AppTrust for lifecycle stage information
- Monitor service dashboards for deployment health

**Troubleshooting:**
- Review GitHub Actions logs for failed promotions
- Check quality gate results in CI/CD pipelines
- Verify JFrog AppTrust connectivity and permissions

### Best Practices

- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure comprehensive testing in lower stages
- **Monitor Promotions**: Watch for failed quality gates or deployment issues
- **Plan Rollbacks**: Have rollback procedures ready for production issues
- **Document Changes**: Maintain clear release notes and change logs

**Note**: Promotions to PROD require additional approvals and may have restricted time windows for safety.
