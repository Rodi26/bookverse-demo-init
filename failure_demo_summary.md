# BookVerse QA Gate - Comprehensive Evidence Rules with Failure Scenarios

## ✅ Complete Policy Set Now Includes Failure Demonstrations

### Current Active Policies for bookverse-QA Entry Gate:

#### 1. ✅ Success-Path Evidence Rules:
- **DEV Stage Completion** - Checks for DEV.Exit certification
- **SBOM Evidence** - Requires CycloneDX SBOM from build
- **Custom Integration Tests** - Custom evidence type validation

#### 2. 🚨 Failure Demonstration Rules:
- **STAGING Check (Demo Failure)** - Rule ID: 1970836727707402240
  - Looks for: STAGING.Exit AppTrust Gate Certification
  - Expected Result: FAIL (evidence shouldn't exist at QA entry)
  - Purpose: Demonstrates missing evidence warning behavior

- **Production Readiness (Demo Failure)** - Rule ID: 1970836766838632448  
  - Looks for: https://bookverse.demo/evidence/production-readiness/v1
  - Expected Result: FAIL (evidence generated much later in lifecycle)
  - Purpose: Shows custom evidence failure scenarios

### Policy Behavior Matrix:

| Policy | Evidence Type | Expected at QA Entry | Result | Mode |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|--------|------|
| DEV Completion | DEV.Exit Certification | ✅ YES | PASS | warning |
| SBOM Required | CycloneDX SBOM | ✅ YES | PASS | warning |
| Integration Tests | Custom Integration Tests | ✅ YES | PASS | warning |
| STAGING Check | STAGING.Exit Certification | ❌ NO | FAIL | warning |
| Prod Readiness | Production Readiness | ❌ NO | FAIL | warning |

### Demonstration Value:

1. **Success Cases**: Shows properly configured evidence validation
2. **Failure Cases**: Demonstrates warning behavior for missing evidence
3. **Custom Evidence**: Proves flexibility for any evidence type
4. **Policy Orchestration**: Multiple rules working together
5. **Warning Mode**: Non-blocking evaluation for testing/demo

### Evidence Timeline Simulation:

```
DEV Stage:
├── Generate SBOM Evidence ✅
├── Run Integration Tests ✅  
└── DEV.Exit Certification ✅

QA Entry Evaluation:
├── Check DEV Evidence → PASS ✅
├── Check SBOM → PASS ✅
├── Check Integration Tests → PASS ✅
├── Check STAGING Evidence → FAIL ❌ (expected)
└── Check Prod Readiness → FAIL ❌ (expected)

STAGING Stage (future):
├── STAGING.Exit Certification (not yet generated)
└── Production Readiness Evidence (not yet generated)
```

## 🎯 Perfect Demo Scenario:

The BookVerse QA entry gate now demonstrates:
- ✅ Real evidence validation (3 success cases)
- ❌ Missing evidence handling (2 failure cases)  
- 🔧 Custom evidence types working
- 📊 Complete policy evaluation workflow
- ⚠️ Warning mode for safe testing

This provides a comprehensive demonstration of the Unified Policy Service capabilities!
