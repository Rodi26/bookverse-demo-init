# =============================================================================
#
# Creates and configures the foundational JFrog project for the BookVerse platform
#
# üéØ PURPOSE:
#     This script creates the core JFrog project that serves as the foundation for all
#     BookVerse platform operations. The project acts as a logical container for
#     repositories, applications, lifecycle stages, and security policies, enabling
#     centralized management and governance of the entire platform ecosystem.
#
# üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE:
#     - Project Creation: Establishes project with unlimited storage and full privileges
#     - Admin Configuration: Configures management permissions for complete platform control
#     - API Integration: Uses JFrog Access API for project provisioning and validation
#     - Idempotent Operations: Safely handles repeated execution without duplicate creation
#     - Error Recovery: Comprehensive error handling with detailed failure diagnostics
#
# üöÄ KEY FEATURES:
#     - Automated project creation with standardized configuration
#     - Unlimited storage quota configuration for enterprise-scale operations
#     - Full administrative privileges enabling complete platform management
#     - Conflict detection and resolution for existing projects
#     - Comprehensive logging and status reporting throughout the creation process
#
# üìä BUSINESS LOGIC:
#     - Platform Foundation: Establishes the organizational structure for all BookVerse resources
#     - Resource Management: Enables centralized governance and policy enforcement
#     - Team Collaboration: Provides shared workspace for development and operations teams
#     - Enterprise Compliance: Supports audit trails and access control requirements
#     - Operational Excellence: Standardizes project configuration across environments
#
# üîß USAGE PATTERNS:
#     - Initial Setup: First step in complete platform provisioning workflow
#     - Environment Creation: Foundation for DEV, QA, STAGING, and PROD environments
#     - Disaster Recovery: Project recreation for backup and restore operations

#
# üí° EXAMPLES:
#     [Basic Usage]
#     ./create_project.sh
#     
#     [CI/CD Integration]
#     - name: Create BookVerse Project
#       run: ./.github/scripts/setup/create_project.sh
#       env:
#         PROJECT_KEY: bookverse
#         PROJECT_DISPLAY_NAME: "BookVerse Platform"
#         JFROG_URL: ${{ vars.JFROG_URL }}
#         JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN }}
#     
#     [Local Development]
#     export PROJECT_KEY="bookverse-dev"
#     export PROJECT_DISPLAY_NAME="BookVerse Development"
#     ./create_project.sh
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR HANDLING:
#     [Common Failure Modes]
#     - Missing Environment Variables: Validates all required configuration before execution
#     - Invalid Admin Token: Verifies token permissions and platform connectivity
#     - Project Already Exists: Handles conflicts gracefully with appropriate logging
#     - Network Connectivity: Provides clear diagnostics for API communication failures
#     
#     [Recovery Procedures]
#     - Environment Validation: Check config.sh and environment variable configuration
#     - Token Verification: Ensure admin token has project creation privileges
#     - Platform Connectivity: Verify JFrog Platform accessibility and API availability
#     - Conflict Resolution: Existing projects are detected and reported as success
#
# üîç DEBUGGING:
#     [Debug Mode]
#     DEBUG=true ./create_project.sh    # Enable detailed debug output
#     
#     [Verification Steps]
#     1. Check JFrog Platform UI for created project
#     2. Verify project configuration matches specified parameters
#     3. Confirm admin privileges are properly configured
#     4. Test project accessibility with provided credentials
#     
#     [Common Issues]
#     - Insufficient Permissions: Ensure admin token has project creation rights
#     - Invalid Project Key: Verify project key format meets JFrog requirements
#     - Platform Connectivity: Check network access and JFrog Platform availability
#
# üîó INTEGRATION POINTS:
#     [Dependent Scripts]
#     - create_repositories.sh: Creates repositories within the project
#     - create_applications.sh: Sets up AppTrust applications in the project
#     - create_stages.sh: Configures lifecycle stages for the project
#     - create_oidc.sh: Establishes OIDC authentication for the project
#     
#     [External Services]
#     - JFrog Access API: Project creation and management operations
#     - JFrog Platform UI: Visual confirmation and management interface
#     - CI/CD Pipelines: Automated project provisioning workflows
#
# üìä PERFORMANCE:
#     [Execution Time]
#     - Typical Runtime: 2-5 seconds for project creation
#     - Network Latency: Dependent on JFrog Platform response times
#     - Conflict Detection: Sub-second for existing project validation
#     
#     [Resource Usage]
#     - CPU: Minimal - basic JSON processing and HTTP operations
#     - Memory: Minimal - small JSON payloads and response processing
#     - Network: Single HTTPS POST request to JFrog Platform API
#
# üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
#     [Credential Security]
#     - Admin token passed via environment variables only
#     - No credential logging or exposure in output streams
#     - Secure HTTPS communication with JFrog Platform APIs
#     
#     [Access Control]
#     - Requires admin-level privileges for project creation
#     - Project configured with full management capabilities
#     - Audit trail maintained through JFrog Platform logging
