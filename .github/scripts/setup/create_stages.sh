# BookVerse Platform - Application Lifecycle Stage Creation and AppTrust Integration Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This comprehensive setup script automates the creation and configuration of
# application lifecycle stages and AppTrust integration for the BookVerse platform
# within the JFrog Platform ecosystem, implementing enterprise-grade application
# lifecycle management, stage-based promotion workflows, and compliance-driven
# deployment pipelines for production-ready lifecycle governance and operations.
#
# üèóÔ∏è LIFECYCLE STAGE STRATEGY:
#     - Multi-Environment Lifecycle: Complete DEV ‚Üí QA ‚Üí STAGING ‚Üí PROD promotion pipeline
#     - AppTrust Integration: Native integration with JFrog AppTrust for application lifecycle management
#     - Stage-Based Security: Environment-specific security policies and access control
#     - Promotion Workflows: Automated stage promotion with validation and approval gates
#     - Evidence Collection: Comprehensive audit trail and cryptographic evidence at each stage
#     - Compliance Framework: SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR compliance integration across lifecycle stages
#
# üîÑ APPLICATION LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
#     - Stage Definition: Structured definition of deployment environments and promotion criteria
#     - Promotion Gates: Automated validation and approval workflows between lifecycle stages
#     - Quality Assurance: Testing and validation requirements for stage progression
#     - Security Validation: Security scanning and compliance verification at each stage
#     - Performance Benchmarking: Performance validation and SLA verification for stage promotion
#     - Rollback Capabilities: Stage-aware rollback and disaster recovery procedures
#
# üõ°Ô∏è ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE:
#     - Stage-Based Access Control: Environment-specific user permissions and role assignments
#     - Compliance Integration: Regulatory compliance validation and audit trail maintenance
#     - Security Policies: Stage-specific security policies and vulnerability management
#     - Audit Trail: Complete lifecycle stage operation history and compliance documentation
#     - Change Management: Enterprise change management integration and approval workflows
#     - Risk Management: Stage-based risk assessment and threat detection integration
#
# üîß APPTRUST INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
#     - Application Versioning: Semantic versioning and application lifecycle coordination
#     - Evidence Collection: Cryptographic evidence generation and validation at each stage
#     - Promotion Automation: Automated stage promotion with AppTrust lifecycle management
#     - Quality Gates: Automated quality validation and promotion criteria enforcement
#     - Security Scanning: Integrated security scanning and vulnerability assessment
#     - Compliance Reporting: Automated compliance reporting and audit trail generation
#
# üìà SCALABILITY AND PERFORMANCE:
#     - Multi-Project Support: Scalable stage management across multiple BookVerse projects
#     - Stage Optimization: Performance-optimized stage configuration and promotion workflows
#     - Parallel Processing: Concurrent stage operations and promotion workflow optimization
#     - Load Distribution: Stage-based load balancing and resource optimization
#     - Global Distribution: Multi-region stage deployment and geographic distribution
#     - Monitoring Integration: Stage-based monitoring and alerting configuration
#
# üîê ADVANCED LIFECYCLE FEATURES:
#     - Dynamic Stage Configuration: Runtime stage configuration and policy adjustment
#     - Conditional Promotion: Business rule-based promotion criteria and validation
#     - A/B Testing Integration: Experimental deployment and testing framework integration
#     - Canary Deployments: Progressive deployment and rollout management across stages
#     - Blue-Green Deployment: Zero-downtime deployment patterns and stage coordination
#     - Feature Flags: Feature flag integration and stage-based feature management
#
# üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
#     - JFrog Platform Integration: Native stage management via JFrog Platform APIs
#     - AppTrust API Integration: Direct integration with AppTrust lifecycle management
#     - REST API Automation: Programmatic stage creation and lifecycle configuration
#     - JSON Configuration: Structured stage definition and lifecycle policy specification
#     - Error Handling: Comprehensive error detection and recovery for lifecycle operations
#     - Validation Framework: Stage configuration validation and lifecycle testing
#
# üìã LIFECYCLE STAGE CONFIGURATION:
#     - Development Stage (DEV): Initial development and feature validation environment
#     - Quality Assurance Stage (QA): Comprehensive testing and quality validation environment
#     - Staging Stage (STAGING): Production-like pre-production validation environment
#     - Production Stage (PROD): Live production environment with full business operations
#     - Hotfix Stages: Emergency hotfix deployment and validation workflows
#     - Experimental Stages: A/B testing and experimental feature deployment environments
#
# üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
#     - Stage Creation: All BookVerse lifecycle stages successfully provisioned
#     - AppTrust Integration: Complete AppTrust lifecycle management configuration
#     - Promotion Workflows: Automated stage promotion and validation workflows operational
#     - Compliance Readiness: Lifecycle management meeting enterprise audit requirements
#     - Security Validation: Stage-based security policies and access control operational
#     - Operational Excellence: Lifecycle management ready for production deployment operations
#
# Authors: BookVerse Platform Team
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2024
#
# Dependencies:
#   - common.sh (shared utilities and configuration)
#   - JFrog Platform with AppTrust (application lifecycle management)
#   - Valid administrative credentials (admin tokens)
#   - Network connectivity to JFrog Platform endpoints
#   - Stage configuration templates and policies
#
# AppTrust Integration Notes:
#   - Stages must follow BookVerse naming convention: {PROJECT_KEY}-{STAGE_NAME}
#   - Production stage is globally named "PROD" and always exists as the last stage
#   - Stage promotion requires evidence collection and cryptographic validation
#   - Compliance frameworks are automatically integrated with stage operations
