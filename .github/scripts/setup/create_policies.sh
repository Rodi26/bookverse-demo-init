# BookVerse Platform - Unified Policy Creation Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This comprehensive script creates and configures all BookVerse unified
# policies according to the specified lifecycle gate requirements, implementing
# enterprise-grade policy management for evidence collection, compliance
# enforcement, and lifecycle gate automation.
#
# üöÄ POLICY ARCHITECTURE:
#     - DEV Stage: Entry gates for Jira, SLSA, build evidence (SonarQube), Docker evidence (SAST), and package evidence (unit tests); Exit gate for smoke tests
#     - QA Stage: Exit gates for DAST and Postman collection testing
#     - STAGING Stage: Exit gates for penetration testing, change management, and IaC scanning
#     - PROD Stage: Release gates for stage completion verification
#
# üìã POLICIES CREATED:
#     DEV Entry: Atlassian Jira Required, SLSA Provenance Required, Build Quality Gate Required, Docker SAST Evidence Required, Package Unit Test Evidence Required
#     DEV Exit: Smoke Test Required
#     QA Exit: Invicti DAST Required, Postman Collection Required
#     STAGING Exit: Cobalt Pentest Required, ServiceNow Change Required, Snyk IaC Required
#     PROD Release: DEV Completion Required, QA Completion Required, STAGING Completion Required
