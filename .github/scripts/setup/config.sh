# BookVerse Platform - Centralized Configuration Management Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This critical configuration script provides centralized environment variable
# management and platform-wide configuration standards for the BookVerse
# ecosystem, implementing enterprise-grade configuration governance, security
# best practices, and operational consistency across all setup automation
# scripts and deployment operations.
#
# üîß CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
#     - Centralized Configuration: Single source of truth for all platform configuration
#     - Environment Variable Standards: Consistent naming and structure across all scripts
#     - Security Configuration: Secure credential management and API authentication
#     - Repository Management: Standardized artifact repository configuration and access
#     - Lifecycle Stage Management: Environment promotion and deployment stage definitions
#     - Integration Standards: GitHub Actions, JFrog Platform, and OIDC configuration
#
# üìä PLATFORM CONFIGURATION DOMAINS:
#     - Project Identity: Core project identification and branding configuration
#     - JFrog Platform: Complete JFrog Platform integration and authentication
#     - Repository Management: Artifact repository organization and access patterns
#     - Environment Stages: Deployment lifecycle and promotion stage definitions
#     - Security Integration: OIDC authentication and cryptographic configuration
#     - Operational Parameters: API timeouts, retry logic, and performance tuning
#
# üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE CONFIGURATION:
#     - Credential Management: Secure handling of authentication tokens and API keys
#     - OIDC Integration: GitHub Actions OpenID Connect authentication configuration
#     - Repository Security: Secure artifact repository access and permission management
#     - Cryptographic Standards: RSA key size and security algorithm configuration
#     - API Security: Timeout and retry configuration for secure API operations
#     - Audit Trail: Configuration change tracking and compliance documentation
#
# üöÄ USAGE PATTERNS AND INTEGRATION:
#     - Script Sourcing: Universal configuration import for all setup scripts
#     - Environment Validation: Required configuration validation and error handling
#     - Cross-Script Consistency: Standardized configuration across all automation
#     - Dynamic Configuration: Runtime configuration validation and adjustment
#     - Error Recovery: Configuration failure detection and recovery procedures
#     - Documentation Standards: Inline documentation for all configuration variables
#
# üìã CONFIGURATION VARIABLES DOCUMENTATION:
#     - PROJECT_KEY: Core project identifier used throughout BookVerse platform
#     - JFROG_URL: JFrog Platform endpoint for artifact management and AppTrust integration
#     - Repository Configuration: Docker and PyPI repository naming and organization
#     - Stage Definitions: Environment promotion lifecycle and deployment targets
#     - Security Parameters: OIDC configuration and cryptographic standards
#     - Operational Tuning: API timeouts, retry logic, and performance optimization
#
# üîê SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
#     - Token Management: Secure environment variable handling for authentication tokens
#     - Validation Logic: Required configuration validation and security verification
#     - Error Handling: Secure error reporting without credential exposure
#     - Access Control: Configuration-based role and permission management
#     - Audit Compliance: Configuration change logging and compliance tracking
#     - Credential Rotation: Support for credential rotation and security updates
#
# üõ†Ô∏è OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE:
#     - Default Values: Sensible defaults for operational and security parameters
#     - Error Detection: Comprehensive validation for required configuration
#     - Performance Tuning: API timeout and retry configuration for optimal performance
#     - Cache Management: Temporary directory and cache configuration for efficiency
#     - Monitoring Integration: Configuration for observability and alerting systems
#     - Change Management: Configuration versioning and change control procedures
#
# üìà SCALABILITY AND MAINTENANCE:
#     - Environment Scaling: Configuration support for multi-environment deployments
#     - Repository Scaling: Artifact repository organization for growth and expansion
#     - Security Scaling: Cryptographic and authentication configuration for enterprise scale
#     - Performance Scaling: API and operational parameter tuning for high-volume operations
#     - Compliance Scaling: Configuration management for regulatory and audit requirements
#     - Integration Scaling: Configuration standards for new service and tool integration
