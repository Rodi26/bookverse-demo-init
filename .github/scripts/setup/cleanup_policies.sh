# BookVerse Platform - Unified Policy and Rules Cleanup Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This script safely removes all BookVerse unified policies and rules during 
# platform cleanup operations, ensuring complete removal of policy configurations
# while maintaining data integrity and proper cleanup sequencing.
#
# üóëÔ∏è CLEANUP OPERATIONS:
#     - Rules Identification: Locate all BookVerse custom rules
#     - Policy Identification: Locate all BookVerse project policies  
#     - Safe Removal: Remove rules first, then policies in proper dependency order
#     - Verification: Confirm complete policy and rule removal
#     - Error Handling: Robust error handling for cleanup operations
#     - Detailed Reporting: Report on which rules and policies will be deleted
#
# Authors: BookVerse Platform Team
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2024
